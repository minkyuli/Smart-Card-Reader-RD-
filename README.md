# Smart-Card-Reader(RD)

This is for All Business people.

Most Business people always have name cards.
And They're alwayes preparing to give and take their one's name cards.

In the past, we had to have real things made by paper
But, nowadays, we don't need to that anymore.

we can store name card's infomation easily using AI technology.
Furthermore, we can obtain more information such as context information, location, circumstance, etc

In conclusions, we aim to develop the Smart AI system to collect name cards and to manage name cards
